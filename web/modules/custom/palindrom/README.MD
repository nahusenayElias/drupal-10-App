 #### palindrom.module: Contains the main logic for checking palindromes.

* palindrom.routing.yml:

* palindrom.libraries.yml:

* palindrom.info.yml:


### Some of the steps are as follows:

- Create a custome module

- Add YAML files (info, routing and libraries)

- Create a `'src'` folder and under it another `'Controller'` and Controller php file.

- Add node modules and react logic.

 ```bash
lando drush en module_name -y
```
